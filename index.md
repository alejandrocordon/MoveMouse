### Movemouse

Movemouse is a MacOS Application that moves the mouse based on <a href="https://gist.github.com/vorce/04e660526473beecdc3029cf7c5a761c">Vorce/Jerry </a> project. It uses <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/cgevent">CGEvent</a> that defines an opaque type that represents a low-level hardware event.
It ofers a simple interface to randomly move the mouse across the screen.

Code example:
  

  
  ```
This following code is used to **move** the mouse from one point to another.

  `CGEvent(mouseEventSource: nil, 
          mouseType: CGEventType.mouseMoved, 
          mouseCursorPosition: point, 
          mouseButton: CGMouseButton.left)?.post(tap: CGEventTapLocation.cghidEventTap)`
  

It can be uset also to **click** in some points of the screen using the next function:

  `
  CGEvent(mouseEventSource: nil, 
          mouseType: CGEventType.leftMouseUp, 
          mouseCursorPosition: point, 
          mouseButton: mouseButton)?.post(tap: CGEventTapLocation.cghidEventTap)
  `

```
