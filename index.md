### Movemouse

Movemouse is a MacOS Application that moves the mouse based on <a href="https://gist.github.com/vorce/04e660526473beecdc3029cf7c5a761c">Vorce/Jerry </a> project. It uses <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/cgevent">CGEvent</a> that defines an opaque type that represents a low-level hardware event.
  
Example:
  
```
  CGEvent(mouseEventSource: nil, mouseType: CGEventType.mouseMoved, mouseCursorPosition: point, mouseButton: CGMouseButton.left)?.post(tap: CGEventTapLocation.cghidEventTap)
  
```
  

### Usage

Don't forget to allow the app in settings security/accesilibity (each time you compile if you are using it directly from XCode)
